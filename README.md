<b>BayesFactorFMRI provides a GUI to </b>
 1. Bayesian 2nd-level analysis of fMRI data with multiple comparison correction and
 2. Bayesian meta-analysis of fMRI studies.

To test this tool, R (>= 3.5) and Python (>= 3.7.3; Python 3.8 is not recommended due to package-related issues at this point) are required. Plus, these additional packages should be installed:<p>
 R: BayesFactor, metaBMA, oro.nifti<p>
 Python: tkinter (for GUI), shutil, pandas, nibabel, rpy2, subprocess, numpy, nilearn (os, math, atexit, glob)<p>

 To install dependencies:
 1. R packages <p>
 In the R console, execute: <p>
 install.packages('BayesFactor') <p>
 install.packages('metaBMA')<p>
 install.packages('oro.nifti')  *A quick note on 11/24/21: please install the most up-to-date oro.nift, 0.11.0 (as of 11/24/21), to avoid any bug during the result image creation process.*<p>

 2. Python packages<p>
 To install the following Python packages, execute the following command at the terminal:<p>
 pip (or pip3) install shutil<p>
 pip (or pip3) install pandas<p>
 pip (or pip3) install nibabel<p>
 pip (or pip3) install rpy2<p>
 pip (or pip3) install subprocess<p>
 pip (or pip3) install numpy<p>
 pip (or pip3) install -U --user nilearn (for further details, refer to https://nilearn.github.io/introduction.html#installing-nilearn)<p>

 After installing all required dependencies, follow directions below:

 1. Download contents (codes and etc.) in V1.0.0.
 2. Download tutorial images files in the designated subfolder(s) (i.e. /Correction for (1) and /Meta for (2)).
 3. Run bayes_select_ui.py with Python to start either correction_ui or bmeta_ui. At the terminal, execute: python (or python3) bayes_select_ui.py
 4. Follow the directions provided with the GUI.

At the last stage, you will decide either to run the analysis locally or on a cluster.
Once you decide to run the analysis locally, then GUI will call Python and R automatically at the end of the process.
If you choose to run the analysis on a cluster, the GUI will end. You have to upload created files (including both codes, image files, etc.) to a cluster and run run_this.py. These files will be created in a working directory that you specify in GUI. In this process, you may need to write additional code(s) to run run_this.py on the cluster (e.g., slurm batch including "python (or python3) run_this.py").
